# 2024-12-15 Possible pattern injection in notORM

Prior to commit a00b1b00ee64215dfdd575cf3c51e2f7c387761f, notORM was vulnerable to a pattern
injection attack, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation through the account system.

The vulnerability arose due to an inconsistency with how certain versions of sed handle escaped
hex characters (`\xNN`). GNU sed expands the escaped characters and treats them as a raw part of
the pattern as long as Extended Regex (`-E`) mode is used. This behavior is not present within
busybox sed, which is why it hasn't been caught before.
